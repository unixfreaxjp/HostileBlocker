### You are in HostileBlocker project

This project was started meant to support the usage of blocklist in twitter using the BlockTogether tool. 
By this tool you could  extract the list of the blocklist in a text file via bash shell command, to help the multipurpose customization and usage for your needs. Due to the API changes the tool is currently not working, but the concept can still be used for your similar purpose, it is now shared for the security community.

The example of the common USAGE commands is as follows:

```
$ bash hostilefeed.sh             # extracting text data in stdout
$ bash hostilefeed.sh | wc -l     # counting the records
$ bash hostilefeed.sh >> file.txt # dumping the output into the file
```

The tool has just been released for the good purpose only.
